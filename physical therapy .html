      Physical therapy, often abbreviated as PT, is a healthcare profession that focuses on the assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of physical impairments, disabilities, and movement-related conditions. Physical therapists, also known
      as physiotherapists in some regions, are licensed healthcare professionals who specialize in optimizing physical function and promoting overall well-being.</p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Evaluation and Assessment: Physical therapists assess individuals' physical abilities, range of motion, strength, posture, and movement patterns. They analyze the impact of these factors on overall function and identify areas of concern or dysfunction.</li>
      <br><br>
      <li>Treatment Planning: Based on the assessment, physical therapists develop personalized treatment plans tailored to the individual's specific needs and goals. Treatment plans may include therapeutic exercises, manual therapy, functional training, and other interventions.</li><br><br>
      <li>Pain Management: Physical therapists utilize various techniques to manage pain associated with musculoskeletal conditions, injuries, or chronic conditions. These may include therapeutic exercises, heat or cold therapy, electrical stimulation, and manual techniques.</li><br><br>
      <li>Rehabilitation and Recovery: Physical therapy plays a crucial role in helping individuals recover from injuries, surgeries, or debilitating conditions. Physical therapists guide patients through rehabilitation programs to regain strength, flexibility, and mobility, and to restore functional independence.</li><br><br>
      <li>Improvement of Mobility and Movement: Physical therapists work on improving individuals' mobility and movement abilities. They help patients overcome movement limitations, address gait abnormalities, and enhance balance and coordination.</li><br><br>
